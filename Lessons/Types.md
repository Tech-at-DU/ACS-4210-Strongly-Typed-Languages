## [**15m**] 💻 **Warmup**: Tutorial Review Questions

In our first class, students were asked to complete <https://go.dev/tour/moretypes> and <https://go.dev/tour/methods> for homework.

For warmup, break students into small groups and ask them to write **two review questions for each section (_total 4_)** and submit them on the following [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abDp0UH2HIR1RJPcYhbz1Hrs4092gr2maqBVwtafnUk/edit).

Students **do not need to answer any questions, yet**!

<!-- > -->

## [**30m**] 💻 **Activity**: What's Your Type?

Break students into a number of groups matching the list of topics.

**Each group should produce at least 4 slides in order to deliver a presentation of at least 3 minutes.**

### Topics

1. int / float / complex
1. string / rune
1. array / map
1. interface / channel
1. struct / slice

### Slides Should Contain

1. Tell me **at least 3 facts about each data type(s) or primitive(s)**.
2. What **size(s) of data** can it hold?
3. Give **5 common examples** of when an engineer might use each with an **example of what that data value may look like** in real life.
