## Course Description

_In this course, students discover the value of strongly typed languages in server-side architectures, and dive deep into performant, concurrent programming paradigms present in Go. In studying Go, which is known for its ability to blend the expressive features of dynamic languages (Python, JavaScript) with the performance capabilities of compiled languages (C, C++), students will gain the syntactic diversity required in today's large-scale platform engineering pursuits. Throughout the course, students will learn and implement the design patterns and best practices that make Go a top choice at high-velocity startups like Lyft, Heroku, Docker, and Medium._

# Holidays & Offline Sessions

On the following days this term, our class will **NOT be meeting online** on Zoom:

1. `Monday, April 01, 2024`: Campus Holiday
2. `Monday, April 22, 2024`: Lab Day for [Final Project](Project/MakeUtility.md)

## Evaluation

We will be using Gradescope this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Dominican University email, and your password can be changed at <https://gradescope.com/reset_password>. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

**To pass this course you must meet the following requirements**:

- Complete the [tutorial](#tutorial), [deliverables](#deliverables), [final project](#final-project), and [final presentation](#final-presentation) as assigned in class and described in the sections below.
- Make up all activities, classwork, and drills from all absences.
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy.

### Tutorial

Complete the [tutorial](https://tour.golang.org) assigned for homework on Day 01 and Day 02. Tutorial completion will be assessed via a series of drills, introduced by the instructor and completed in class. All drills must be turned in on [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).

### Blog Post

Demonstrate confidence writing and speaking about Go topics by writing a 500+ blog post on a language feature of your choice.

Your blog post must be accessible to the general public to earn credit; do not submit draft posts.

Your grade will be determined via the [ACS Blog Post Rubric](). **You must earn a score of 2.5 or higher to pass**.

### Final Project

Complete the final project according to the associated [project rubric](Project/MakeUtility.md).

### Final Presentation

The delivery of a live or pre-recorded presentation is required to pass this course. **Presentations will be delivered on our final day of class**.

Your **three to five minute presentation** should focus on the **experience you gained** and **lessons you learned** while implementing one of the three [Challenges](#challenges) in this course.

**Your final presentation will be evaluated based on the ACS Presentation Rubric. You must earn an average of 2.5 on the rubric to pass**.

## Late Assignment Policy

The **absolute last day** to submit any assignment will be **Sunday, May 12 at 11:59 PM**.

If you require accommodations or have extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness, please contact your instructor to request an extension.
